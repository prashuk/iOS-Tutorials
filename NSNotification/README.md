# NSNotification

NSNotificationCenter can be seen as a tool for communicating information within your app. Unlike push or local notifications where you are notifying a user of any content you would like them to receive,

NSNotificationCenter allows us to send and receive information between classes and/or structs based on an action that has occurred in our app.

`NotificationCenter.default` is where all notifications are posted to and are observed from. Each notification must have a unique way to identify themselves, which would then represent the channel we are tuning in to if we continue with our analogy. In this same way, if we were to observe, or listen, to any channel, we would call on the observe method available to us through `NotificationCenter.default` and perform some type of action based on this listening.

Remember when I mentioned that each notification should have a unique identity? Well, Iâ€™ve created an extension on `Notification.Name` and added two static properties with the name of each channel. Normally you can manually type in the string containing the name you would like to use for your notification when you call on the observe or post methods, but this helps us steer away from bugs and leaves less space for errors due to misspellings.

### For post:

NotificationCenter.default.post(name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: "Mumbai"), object: nil)

### For Observer (in viewDidLoad()):

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(setToMumbai(notification:)), name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: "Mumbai"), object: nil)
